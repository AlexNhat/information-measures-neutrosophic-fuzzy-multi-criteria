# information-measures-neutrosophic-fuzzy-multi-criteria
This project introduces similarity-based information measures (entropy and cross-entropy) for neutrosophic fuzzy sets (NF-sets), a hybrid combining fuzzy and neutrosophic sets for indeterminate data. It includes theorems proving properties and an improved multi-criteria decision-making algorithm for qualitative and quantitative aspects.
